    <p>Brady was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mateo,_California">San Mateo, California</a>, on August 3, 1977, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_name#Maiden_and_married_names">née</a> Johnson) and Thomas Brady Sr. Brady was raised as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic">Catholic</a>. His father is of Irish descent, while his mother has Swedish, Norwegian, German, and Polish ancestry. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, Brady regularly attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> games at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_Park">Candlestick Park</a>, where he was a fan of quarterback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana">Joe Montana</a> and considered him his idol and one of his inspirations. When he was four, he attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981%E2%80%9382_NFL_playoffs#NFC_Championship:_San_Francisco_49ers_28,_Dallas_Cowboys_27">1981 NFL Championship</a>, against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, in which Montana threw "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catch_(American_football)">The Catch</a>" to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Clark">Dwight Clark</a>. Brady learned to throw a football at a camp run by future NFL/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Football_League">AFL</a> quarterback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Graziani">Tony Graziani</a>. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In high school, Brady attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun%C3%ADpero_Serra_High_School_(San_Mateo,_California)">Junípero Serra High School</a> in San Mateo, where he played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football">football</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">baseball</a>. Initially, he was the backup quarterback on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_varsity">junior varsity</a> team but eventually became the varsity starter. In his senior year, hhe was actively seeking college recruitment, creating highlight tapes to attract attention from various football programs. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>Brady was also known as a great baseball player in high school. He was a left-handed batting catcher with power. His catching skills impressed MLB scouts, and he was drafted in the 18th round of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_MLB_Draft">1995 MLB Draft</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Expos">Montreal Expos</a>, and was projected to become one of the greatest catchers ever, but instead, he was recruited by Michigan football asssistant Bill Harris, signing to play for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan</a> in 1995. He'd become the last active athlete drafted by the Expos and also won All-State and All-Far West honours and the team's Most Valuable Player Award. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In college, Brady played football for the University of Michigan for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football">Wolverines</a> from 1995 to 1999. He started as a backup quarterback at the University of Michigan, struggling to get playing time and even considering transferring. Brady became the starting quarterback in his junior year, setting records for pass attempts and completions. Brady led Michigan to notable victories, including a comeback win against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football_team">Penn State</a> and an overtime win in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Bowl">Orange Bowl</a> against Alabama. He finishes his college career with 5,351 passing yards and 35 touchdown passes, ranking high in Michigan's history. He graduated from Michigan in December 1999 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Studies">General Studies</a>. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>

    <h2>Professional career</h2>
    <p>Brady's success as a passer has been attributed to his work ethic, competitive spirit, pocket awareness, and intelligence. Despite this, he was largely unimpressive coming out of college and as a result, wasn't drafted until the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots, being 199th overall. He started the 2000 season as the backup quarterback for the New England Patriots. Drew Bledsoe was the starting quarterback. In their second game of the 2001 season on September 23, Drew Bledsoe was seriously injured and suffered internal bleeding from a hit by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Brady took over as the starting quarterback after the Patriots achieved a blowout 44-13 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the third game. Brady began to find his stride and led the Patriots to a playoff spot. Although he suffered a knee injury, he returned to win the AFC Championship and lead the Patriots to a 20-17 victory against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI">Super Bowl XXXVI</a>. Bledsoe was eventually traded to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> in April of 2002, which cemented Brady's status as the starting quarterback. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>After 12 consecutive wins in 2003 and a final win to loss ratio of 14-2, Brady led the Patriots to a 32-29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a> and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. In 2004, Brady earned another Super Bowl win for the Patriots, narrowly defeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> 24-21 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIX">Super Bowl XXXIX</a>. The New England Patriots were the last team to win back-to-back Super Bowls until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> in 2023. In 2007, the Patriots played a perfect season and won 18 straight games, but lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLII">Super Bowl XLII</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants">New York Giants</a>, with a final score of 17-14. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In 2008, Brady was sidelined by a serious injury to his left knee midway through the first quarter in the season opener from a hit by Kansas City Chiefs safety <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Pollard">Bernard Pollard</a> and did not return for the remainder of the season. The injury left him hospitalized and snapped his streak of 111 consecutive starts. Despite his absence, the Patriots still managed to finish the regular season with an 11-5 win record, although they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002 due to tiebreakers. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>Afer a 10 year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl">Super Bowl</a> drought, Tom Brady returned to Super Bowl fame after defeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> 28-24 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIX">Super Bowl XLIX</a>. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana's record. However in the off season, Brady came under fire after a report revealed that he was involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflategate">deflation of footballs used in the previous season's AFC Championship game</a>. He was under investigation for Deflategate and destroyed his phone under suspicious circumstances. As a result, NFL Commissioner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Goodell">Roger Goodell</a> suspended Brady for four games. However, the suspension itself sparked backlash among the NFL fanbase. He served his suspension in the 2016 season and once again led the Patriots to a fifth Super Bowl win, defeating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> 34-28 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LI">Super Bowl LI</a>, completing the largest comeback win in both team history and Super Bowl history. In addition, Brady set another record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LII">Super Bowl LII</a>, Tom Brady faced the Philadelphia Eagles and lost 41-33. This was the third time that Brady had lost in a Super Bowl, becoming the fourth starting quarterback in Super Bowql history to lose at least three Super Bowls joining Jim Kelly, Fran Tarkenton, and John Elway. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In the 2018 NFL season, Patriots coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick">Bell Belichick</a> revamped the Patriots' offensive and defensive strategy to prepare them for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIII">Super Bowl LIII</a>, in which they would play the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>. The result was the lowest scoring game in Super Bowl history, with a 13-3 victory for the Patriots over the Rams. With the victory, the Patriots became the second NFL team to win six Super Bowls, tying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>for the most in NFL history. In addition, Brady became the oldest quarterback at 41 years of age to win a Super Bowl, as well as the first player ever to win six Super Bowls, breaking a tie with Charles Haley. On March 17, 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not re-sign with the team for the 2020 season, ending his 20-year tenure in New Enland.  Three days later, he would sign with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. After wards, billboards thanking Brady for his sservices were posted in twelve different locations around New England. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>After signing with the Buccaneers, Brady later said that playing behind closed doors from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the NFL made it easier for him to execute his new team's unfamiliar football playbook. Tom Brady would then lead the Buccaneers to the playoffs and eventually to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LV">Super Bowl LV</a> against the Kansas City Chiefs. Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns in Tampa Bay's 31-9 win over the Chiefs and was awarded Super Bowl MVP for the game. He had extended his record for most Super Bowl wins by a player with his seventh and extended his record for Super Bowl MVP awards with five. Brady became the second quarterback, joining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning">Peyton Manning</a>, to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins, but the first to win Super Bowl MVP with two different teams. He also became the first quarterback to win the Super Bowl with teams from different conferences, as well as the player with the most championships in NFL history and tied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Graham">Otto Graham</a> for the most league championships in professional football history by a player at seven. With the winm Brady became the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history to start, play, win, and receive the MVP award. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>
    <p>In the 2021 postseason, the Buccaneers lost the Divisional Round to the Rams 30-27. The Rams later went on to win <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVI">Super Bowl LVI</a>. Brady announced his retirement on February 1, 2022. However, he returned for the 2022 season just 40 days later on March 13, 2022, becoming the oldest quarterback to start an NFL game. The 2022 season ended up not being great for Brady and the Buccaneers lost 31-14 against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round. This marked the first time since 2013 that Brady had lost in the playoffs in consecutive seasons. On February 1, 2023, Brady announced on social media that he was retiring "for good". He filed his retirement papers with the NFL and NFLPA nine days later, making Brady eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame starting in 2028. (Wikipedia, 2024)</p>

Together, they have two children: a son, Benjamin Rein Brady, born in December 2009, and a daughter, Vivian Lake Brady, born in December 2012. However, they divorced in October 2022.
